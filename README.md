Visualize Graph Algorithms
==========================

This project is a platform for visualizing all steps of a graph algorithm operations.
The default run of the project shows the steps of Breadth First Traversal of a sample graph.

Run Command

	Python3.5 visGraphAlgo.py  


The goal for this project is to provide user an ability to configure (timing, colors and styles of graph) the visualization experience for a given graph and chosen graph algorithm.
